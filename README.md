# QuantumWorlds
 An (currently unsuccessful) attempt to implement the wavefunction collapse algoritm in QutiePy, as well as a messy (but functional) implementation in plain Python that can produce style-transferred 2d bitmaps from a small example image.

The code here is VERY rough and ready, and was mostly written as a learning 
oppurtunity for myself. It is not meant to be at all 'release-worthy'!
